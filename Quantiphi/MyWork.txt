Video Classification

We can say that videos are a collection of a set of images arranged in a specific order. These sets of images are also referred to as frames.

Steps that we will be following to build our video classification model:
	- Explore the dataset and create the training and validation set. We will use the training set to train the model and validation set to evaluate the trained model
	- Extract frames from all the videos in the training as well as the validation set
	- Preprocess these frames and then train a model using the frames in the training set. Evaluate the model using the frames present in the validation set
	- Once we are satisfied with the performance on the validation set, use the trained model to classify new videos

It is very important to keep the videos belonging to the same group separate in training and testing. Since the videos in a group are obtained from a single long video, sharing videos from the same group in training and testing sets would give high performance.
