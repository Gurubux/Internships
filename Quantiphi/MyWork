Video Classification
"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/09/step-by-step-deep-learning-tutorial-video-classification-python/"
We can say that videos are a collection of a set of images arranged in a specific order. These sets of images are also referred to as frames.

Let me summarize the steps that we will be following to build our video classification model:

Explore the dataset and create the training and validation set. We will use the training set to train the model and validation set to evaluate the trained model
Extract frames from all the videos in the training as well as the validation set
Preprocess these frames and then train a model using the frames in the training set. Evaluate the model using the frames present in the validation set
Once we are satisfied with the performance on the validation set, use the trained model to classify new videos
