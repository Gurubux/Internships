1. Data Science
- Overview
- Terminologies
- Applications
- Module Test

- Overview
Why Data Science
	- Amount of data collected is high. 90% of the data is collected in the past 2 years
	- Data Storage is cheaper
	- Computation cost is cheaper and continue to fall
	AmazonGo
	Driver-less cars
	Impaired vision

- Terminologies
	MIS - Management Information Systems - Collect Data
	Detective Analysis - Answers why has something happened
	Dashboardning/Business Intelligence - Realtime data display. Answers realtime questions
	Predictive Modeling - When you gather past data and predict what is likely to happen at a granular level. Like in a bank which customer is likely to default in 	the next 30 days
	Big Data - Complexity of handling the data goes beyond the traditional systems, due to increase in complexity, volume and variety of data. 


	"Forecasting vs Predictive Modeling vs Machine Learning"
	Forecasting - Process of predicting or estimating the future based on past and present data
	Predictive Modeling - Is more Granular. Used to perform prediction more granular like "Who are the customers who are likely to buy a product in next month" and then act accordingly 
	Machine Learning - Method of teaching machines to learn things and improve predictions/behaviour based on data on thier own.

2. Python
Install Anaconda
python 3.7

We can multiply a string with a number but string and number can not be added.
In python, we do not have any data type for characters, they are treated as string.

if can have multiple conditions as well as else if statement is also available in python whereas elif statement depicts else if statement hence option b is correct.

if (x > y):print('x is greater than y')  âœ”

for i in range(2.0):
        print(i)
==> range only takes integer input and as 2.0 is not an integer, there will be an error while we run this code


for i in range(11,15,3) :
   print (i)

==> 11,14   


List is ordered whereas dictionary is unordered.

Del would remove the elements at a specified index while remove will remove the mentioned elements

.extend() is used to add multiple elements while .append() is used to add single element to a list

Lists can store mix datatypes like numbers and strings together. Since it can have heterogeneous elements as well, the above statement is incorrect.

Dictionaries can include tuples, dictionaries as well as lists.

********
	.update() is used to add more values to a dictionary


Package is a collection of modules and Print function is a part of the standard library

Design and implementation of specific functionality to be incorporated into a program

If you have accidently used a name that is same as a built-in module, then it might be difficult to import that module, which is basically called name clash. This form does not prevents name clash and thus option b is correct.
