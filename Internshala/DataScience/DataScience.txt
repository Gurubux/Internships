- Overview
Why Data Science
	- Amount of data collected is high. 90% of the data is collected in the past 2 years
	- Data Storage is cheaper
	- Computation cost is cheaper and continue to fall
	AmazonGo
	Driver-less cars
	Impaired vision

- Terminologies
	MIS - Management Information Systems - Collect Data
	Detective Analysis - Answers why has something happened
	Dashboardning/Business Intelligence - Realtime data display. Answers realtime questions
	Predictive Modeling - When you gather past data and predict what is likely to happen at a granular level. Like in a bank which customer is likely to default in 	the next 30 days
	Big Data - Complexity of handling the data goes beyond the traditional systems, due to increase in complexity, volume and variety of data. 


	"Forecasting vs Predictive Modeling vs Machine Learning"
	Forecasting - Process of predicting or estimating the future based on past and present data
	Predictive Modeling - Is more Granular. Used to perform prediction more granular like "Who are the customers who are likely to buy a product in next month" and then act accordingly 
	Machine Learning - Method of teaching machines to learn things and improve predictions/behaviour based on data on thier own.

2. Python
Install Anaconda
python 3.7

We can multiply a string with a number but string and number can not be added.
In python, we do not have any data type for characters, they are treated as string.

if can have multiple conditions as well as else if statement is also available in python whereas elif statement depicts else if statement hence option b is correct.

if (x > y):print('x is greater than y')  ✔

for i in range(2.0):
        print(i)
==> range only takes integer input and as 2.0 is not an integer, there will be an error while we run this code


for i in range(11,15,3) :
   print (i)

==> 11,14   


List is ordered whereas dictionary is unordered.

Del would remove the elements at a specified index while remove will remove the mentioned elements

.extend() is used to add multiple elements while .append() is used to add single element to a list

Lists can store mix datatypes like numbers and strings together. Since it can have heterogeneous elements as well, the above statement is incorrect.

Dictionaries can include tuples, dictionaries as well as lists.

********
	.update() is used to add more values to a dictionary


Package is a collection of modules and Print function is a part of the standard library

Design and implementation of specific functionality to be incorporated into a program

If you have accidently used a name that is same as a built-in module, then it might be difficult to import that module, which is basically called name clash. This form does not prevents name clash and thus option b is correct.

3. Statistics
"MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY I"
	Mode of the data
		Mode is the most frequent occuring number which is 8 in the above example.
		Mode is the number which appears most frequently
		df['col'].mode()
		Multiple modes - Bimodal
		Mode is calculated for the categorical variables

	Types of variables
		- Continous
			A continuous variable can take infinite number of possible values. Gender will only have two values as Male or Female and hence it is a categorical variable and not a continuous variable.
		- Categorical
			- Nominal --> No order ==> Gender
			- Ordinal --> If there is an order in the data ==> Feedback (Excellent, Good, Bad) , Year of Study (Senior, Mid Year, Junior)
				As the number of goals can only be some specific numbers like 1,2,3 or 4 whereas the time can have any possible value as 12.5, 13.6, 120, etc. Hence Goals are discrete and Time is continuous.

	Mean
		Average
			df['col'].mean()
			Not a robust metric - If an outlier (value on a different scale than other values) is added to a data, it will affect the mean.
			Highly affected by Outliers
				First 10 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Sum of these numbers will be 129 and hence their mean will be 12.9

"MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY II"
	Outliers in the datasets
		Values which are extremely low are also outliers. Suppose the series is 1,1000,1002,1003,1004,1005,1006. In this case 1 is an outlier.
		Median of the dataset
			Middle value
			ROBUSt and NOT AFFECTED BY OUTLIERS
			First 20 whole numbers are 0 to 19. Now median for even numbers=n/2 and n/2+1, i.e. 10th and 11th term, i.e. 9 and 10. So, the median will be (10+9) / 2 = 9.5
			In case of even numbers, we do not have single middle term and hence we take the average of middle two terms after arranging the data in ascending order.
			Even if we have two middle term in case of even numbers, we take their average and hence the dataset only have one median.

"UNDERSTANDING THE SPREAD OF DATA"
	Spread of the data
		Range
			Range is the difference between the minimum and the maximum value of the series.
			Max - Min
			The minimum and maximum values in the given time is 2.1 hrs and 10.3 hrs respectively. Hence the range will be 10.3 – 2.1 = 8.2 hrs
		IQR
			IQR is the difference between the third and the first quartile and is used to measure the spread of the data.
			0.75th - 0.25th 
			Takes into consideration only 50% of the data spread
			Robust in case of Outliers
			Median of the above dataset is 52. Series to the right of median is : 53 54 54 55. To calculate the third quartie, we can take the median of this series which is : (54+54) / 2 = 54
			
			df['col'].quantile(0.75) - df['col'].quantile(0.25)

		Variance
			Variance is calculated using all the data points and hence is affected by all the data points.
			Adding a constant to each value in a data set does not change the distance between values so the variance remains the same.

		STD
			If the data is being considered a population on its own, we divide by the number of data points, N and If the data is a sample from a larger population, we divide by one fewer than the number of data points in the sample, n−1
			Adding a constant to each value in a data set does not change the distance between values so the standard deviation remains the same.
			How many values, in the below series, fall within one standard deviation of the mean?
			180, 313, 101, 255, 202, 198, 109, 183, 181, 113, 171, 165, 318, 145, 131, 145, 226, 113, 268, 108

			You have to find the number of points that falls in the range within one standard deviation of the mean. So, you can first calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the given data. It comes out to be 181.25 and 64.65 respectively. Now, to calculate one standard deviation above means, you add the standard deviation to the mean once. So, when you add 64.65 (standard deviation) with 181.25 (mean), you approximately get 245, and to calculate one standard deviation below means, you subtract the standard deviation from the mean once. So, when you subtract 64.65 (standard deviation) from 181.25 (mean), you approximately get 117. Hence the range that we get is 117-245. Hence you need to count the numbers which are within this range. You have 11 numbers in this range, so your answer is 11

Histograms
	Used for Continous Variables
	X = bins
	Y = Frequency of Bins

	plt.hist(x = 'col', data=df,bins = 5)

	Different from BAR Graphs in that Bar Graphs are used for categorical variables.
	Each bin in a histogram have same size. We can change the number of bins but the size of each bin will be same.

	Events with just two Outcomes
		Coin
		Hired
		Win/lose

		Bernoulli Trials -  Experiments that have only two Outcomes
		PMD of number of successes in Bernoulli trials is known as a Binomial Distribution

		Likelihood of team Winning = 75%
		Likelihood of team Losing  = 25%
		P(w) = 0.75 = p
		P(l) = 0.25 = q
		Best of 5 games
		Thus, possibilities of number of wins are X = [0,1,2,3,4,5]




	Number of Win(k) Frequency(nCk) 	Probabilities (p^k * q^n-k * nCk)
	0				 1 LLLLL			(0.25)^5 * (0.75)^0 * 1
	1				 5					(0.25)^4 * (0.75)^1 * 5
	2				 10					(0.25)^3 * (0.75)^2 * 10
	3				 10					(0.25)^2 * (0.75)^3 * 10
	4				 5					(0.25)^1 * (0.75)^4 * 5
	5				 1					(0.25)^0 * (0.75)^5 * 1		


	k n

	P(x = k) = nCk * p^k * q^nk
	nCk = n!  / (n-k)! (k!)


	Binomial Distribution is probabilities plot of (p^k * q^n-k * nCk)

	when p=q=0.5 
		then Normal Distribution
	p>q or q>p
		then Skewed Distribution

	probability of success and failure is p and q respectively. Also the sum of these probability is 1. Hence, probability of failure is given by :
	p + q = 1
	
	q = 1 – p


	10 unfair coins are tossed simultaneously where the probability of getting head for each coin is 0.6. Find the probability of getting 4 heads.
	probability is : 10C4 * 0.6^4 * 0.4^6 = 0.11147

	

Probabilities for Continuous Random Variables
	Instead of calculation probability of each value, we calculate the probability of outcome falling in a particular Range
	Probability Mass Distribution into Probability Density Distribution
	Probabilies are calculated by the area under the graph of the probability Density Function
	Continous Random Variables
		A continuous random variable can take any possible value between two points whereas a discrete random variable can only take discrete values.
		Probability density function is used to represent the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.
